##  Project Description

This Chrome Extension helps users **track the time they spend on websites** and analyze their **online productivity habits**. It is designed to classify websites as **productive** (e.g., coding platforms) or **unproductive** (e.g., social media) and present a **daily summary dashboard**. This tool is ideal for professionals, students, and remote workers who want to better manage their time.

##  What the Extension Does

- Tracks time spent on each tab/website in real time.
- Classifies sites into **Productive**, **Unproductive**, or **Neutral** categories.
- Displays a simple popup with the time spent on the current site.
- Shows a **Productivity Dashboard** listing all visited sites and time spent.
- Runs silently in the background while browsing.

---

##  Tools and Technologies Used

### HTML  
- Structures the popup, dashboard, and background logic layout.

### CSS  
- Used for styling popup and dashboard UI elements (colors, layout, spacing).

### JavaScript  
- Handles tab activity, time tracking, and local data storage.  
- Manages classification logic and real-time updates.

### Chrome Extension APIs  
- `tabs` and `storage` APIs to detect active tabs and store user data.

##  Summary

This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional Chrome extension that tracks user behavior for **self-improvement and time awareness**. It combines real-time interaction, local data persistence, and UI design — a complete **real-world use case** of full-stack front-end development.

This is an excellent entry-level project that could evolve into a **professional productivity tool** with more advanced features in the future.
